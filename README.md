Title of Project: 
### Suits + Tent(acle)s 


**Tagline for the project:** An apocalyptic utopian world drowned in a patriarchal bureaucratic regime. Human individuality has been suffocated by a white collar.The invisible claws of the ruling class have sunk into the minds of ordinary people, tearing away the last remnants of freedom and free spirit. And only one being can set this right…

**Description of project:** It’s a shooter type game with the main character who is the last woman on Earth shooting at male bureaucratic zombies. After all the women were wiped out in a terrible capitalism-related accident, our main character was created in a laboratory as an experiment. It all goes wrong, however, when it turns out she can shift into the form of a monster, and that she’s not at all happy with the state of the world around her. Rampant late-stage capitalism, pen-pushing bureaucracy and inequality all around: it’s now her mission to strike down all the people she feels are responsible and to restore the Earth to its natural state.

**Apparatus:** AMIGA 500+

**Emulator version and coding language:** FS UAE 3.2.35, Workbench, AMOS Pro

**Process:** In order to program the game for the Commodore Amiga 500+, we had to find an emulator first. We picked FS-UAE for that. Then, it was onto finding the appropriate files to launch Workbench and Amos PRO. There were two versions of WB available - 2 and 3.1. However, only the 2 was compatible with the PRO version of Amos which was available. The coding language is Basic. The graphics for the game were made with DeluxePaint.

Originally, we attempted to program the game in Assembly by using the Amiga Assembly plugin for Visual Studio Code. That didn’t work, however, as we couldn’t then plug the game into the Amiga Emulator. Then we decided to use AMOS. However, using the program was clunky, as the booting times took forever and it would crash. Copy-Pasting from VSC into AMOS was not possible. Luckily, if you define the hard-drive on the first position in FS-UAE as the folder where you keep the code (in ASC, AMO or AMOS format), then you can import them into the program as text. The subsequent problems with that were version incompatibilities. Before settling on AMOS Pro, we attempted to use a different version, which would not recognize the syntax of the code as valid, so although being able to be copied, it wasn’t able to read it.

Neither ChatGPT nor Deepseek were useful in figuring out either the coding language or the process for programming the games. All the code that we prompted for was either incorrect, gibberish from the side of the program or the links that we were being routed to were dead. It appears that since this is such an old programming system/console, that a lot of the information online is now made obsolete and/or completely unavailable.

For the sprites, we used Deluxe Paint, Aseprite and Pixilart. For the latter two, the sprites had to be converted into Amiga-legible format - IFF, for which XnView was used.
